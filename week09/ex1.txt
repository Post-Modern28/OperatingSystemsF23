For the input file maximal hit rate accessible is 0.375. Random algorithm needs about 400 frame size to achieve this hit rate.
This algorithm is affected by number of frames more than 2 others. Aging algorithm and nfu algorithm achieve hit rate at level of 0.373 with just 60 frames available in RAM.
Random algorithm has hit rate about 0.1 with such frame number. So, nfu and aging algorithms have a huge advantage of random algorithm.
