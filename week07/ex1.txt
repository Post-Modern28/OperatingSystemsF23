First fit:
Execution time: 0.010000 seconds
Throughput: 5500.000000 queries/sec
Best fit:
Execution time: 0.808000 seconds
Throughput: 68.069307 queries/sec
Worst fit:
Execution time: 0.804000 seconds
Throughput: 68.407960 queries/sec

Conclusions: 
first fit is the most efficient in terms of runtime, best fit and worst fit are on the same level and really far away from first fit runtime
