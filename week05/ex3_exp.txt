With a single thread all computations are done on a single core. When doing more threads. some of them are being done in parallel because of multiprocessing. 
The program outperforms ex4.c, because it doesn't need to synchronize between threads. The only thing that remained unknown to me is why its peak is not 4 threads like for ex4, because no more than 4 processes may run in parallel on my device.
Yet, the time keeps decreasing approximately till m=50-80 (I ran it with m=150, 200, 1000 and 2000 and the performance was decreasing). 
Probably, that's because function itself requiers a lot of data to load, so threads help to not waste time while waitig that data, making a process closer to perfectly scalar. 
But then the time needed to switch between the processes starts outweighing this benefit.
